    `<p>
    I am a graduate student at the <strong>University of Pittsburgh  üéì</strong> with a keen interest in building robust, user-friendly systems. üåü 
    I'm also studying <em>Distributed Systems</em> at <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong> üè´, where I'm diving into the complexities of designing scalable solutions that can tackle real-world problems.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    I love turning ideas into reality in the most <strong>efficient</strong> and <strong>quality-focused</strong> way possible. ‚ú® Whether it's designing something from the ground up or optimizing an existing system, 
    I‚Äôm all about creating <strong>seamless interactions</strong> and <strong>smart solutions</strong>. üí° <em>Learning</em> is my daily fuel, constantly driving me to explore new ways to build and improve. üöÄ
    </p><br>
     <p>
    <strong>Let‚Äôs build something amazing together!</strong> ü§ù

    description:
      'This project involved developing a next-generation ATM system that uses facial recognition for secure user authentication. Initially created during a hackathon hosted by PNC Bank, the system first utilized Amazon Rekognition for facial identification. To challenge my comfort zone, I later replaced it with a custom Siamese neural network model, an improvement over traditional CNNs for facial recognition.',

    description:
      'This project is a secure, scalable remote code execution platform. Users submit code through a Next.js frontend, which is executed in isolated Docker containers managed by Kubernetes. Code execution requests are handled via a RabbitMQ queue, with Nginx as a load balancer. Communication uses GraphQL or gRPC for real-time updates. PostgreSQL stores job statuses and user data, while Redis provides quick access to results. The system prioritizes security, resource management, and performance to handle concurrent executions safely.',
